# Welcome to Jekyll!

# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  I’m a Brazilian software engineer who has been working in software development since 2018. Here, you will find
  some of my thoughts about software development, programming languages, software engineering, and other topics related to
  technology and computer science in general — or even unrelated at all. Most of the content is written in English,
  but you may find some posts in Portuguese as well. Enjoy!
