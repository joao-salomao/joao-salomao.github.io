### Felicidade - Marcelo Jeneci

This is one of my favorite music of all time. It speaks about happiness and those days when we feel like the
world will fall apart. This music is a reminder that we should be happy and cherish every single moment of our
lives.

I recorded this video in one of the rooms at [Coblue](https://coblue.com.br), a company where I worked for a few years
ago. I was invited from two friends, Dirlei and Almir, who also worked there to record some videos
of me playing my guitar... and I did it.

I met [Marcelo Jeneci](https://marcelojeneci.online) around 2012 and since then I admire and every single music that he
created. I hope you enjoy it as much as I do.
