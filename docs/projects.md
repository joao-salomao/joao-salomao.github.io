As you may have noticed, I'm a software developer and I really like create new things, even more if it's something that
can help people. Currently, I mainly work as a Software Engineer, but I also have some side projects that I work on my
free time. Here you can find some of them:

### [Smart Feedback](https://smartfeedback.co)

Have you ever had a hard time trying to write a feedback for a subordinate, manager, or even a friend? Smart Feedback is
a tool that helps you to write a feedback using a set of questions that you can answer to make it easier
to write a feedback. Behind the scenes we use AI to analyze your inputs and make a full text feedback for you.

### [Economiza SC](https://github.com/jsappsbr/Economiza-SC)

Economiza SC is a project that aims to help people to save money by showing them the best prices for products on
supermarkets near them. Also, it helps the supermarkets to sell more by showing their products to more people through
the app. The project is still in development, but you can check it
out [here](https://github.com/orgs/jsappsbr/projects/2/views/1).
